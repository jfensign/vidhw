 <p>As an artist, my interests are strongly tied to visualizing mathematical patterns through the use of traditional craft mediums. My work is inspired by exploring and artistically rearticulating existing mathematical theorems. I am fascinated by the order that can arise in any chaotic system through the use of rules, symbols, and numerical values.

Through my practice, I have noticed that mathematics is integral to craft; in which the construction of a pattern relies on using geometry. My technically oriented craftwork requires the constant use of the grid whether I am weaving, embroidering, beading, or drawing. I find a deep comfort in these repetitive processes that use simple arithmetic to generate complex images.

To me, learning one new technique leads to an infinite amount of tangible constructions. The possibilities of contemporary craft can be realized through the experimentation of craft processes, incorporation of personal interests, and variation of media. All of these components help me to conceptualize and construct my mathematically driven artwork.</p>
